# VRshootingGame
A game that utilises Vuforia to create an a castle on an image target. Player has to shoot and destroy the castle.

# What it does
Use the device camera to detect the image target. I have decided to use a $100 bill as the image target as I reckon that would be readily available for most people. Fun face I couldn't use a Canadian bill because of its reflectiveness.

# Technology used:
1. Vuforia
2. Unity
